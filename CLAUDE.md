# Project

This is a Next.js app built at the Slow Ventures Creator Fund AI Hackathon. The user is likely a beginner — be helpful, explain what you're doing, and keep things simple.

# Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router) with TypeScript and React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui (New York style, lucide icons)
- **Auth**: Better Auth — email/password with database sessions
- **Database**: Prisma ORM → PostgreSQL on Neon
- **Hosting**: Vercel (auto-deploys on git push)

# Key files

- `lib/auth.ts` — Better Auth server config (Prisma adapter, email/password, session settings)
- `lib/auth-client.ts` — Better Auth client helpers (React hooks for session, sign in/out)
- `proxy.ts` — route protection middleware (all routes require login by default)
- `prisma/schema.prisma` — database schema (single source of truth for tables)
- `lib/db/prisma.ts` — Prisma client singleton
- `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx` — protected Creator Fund dashboard and onboarding entry point
- `components/dashboard-resource-hub.tsx` — browser-local checklist and workshop-resource hub
- `components/ui/` — shadcn/ui components
- `.env` — environment variables (never commit this)

# Slash commands

| `/help` | Show all commands and tips |

# Rules

## General

- The user is a beginner. Briefly explain what you're doing and why before making changes.
- When creating something new, tell the user how to see it (e.g., "Open localhost:3000/dashboard to see your new page").
- After making changes, suggest the logical next step or ask what to do next.
- Commit frequently — remind the user to run /snapshot after completing a feature.

## Server actions (not API routes)

- Use Server Actions (`"use server"`) for all backend logic. Do not create API routes under `app/api/` (except the existing Better Auth route).
- Server actions go in `lib/actions/` or co-located with the page that uses them.

## Authentication

- Use `auth.api.getSession({ headers: await headers() })` from `@/lib/auth` to get the current session in Server Components and Server Actions. Import `headers` from `next/headers`.
- Use `authClient.useSession()` from `@/lib/auth-client` to get the session in Client Components (no provider wrapper needed).
- The current user's ID is `session.user.id`.
- All routes are protected by default via `proxy.ts`. New pages require login automatically.
- To make a route public, add it to the `publicRoutes` array in `proxy.ts`.
- Do not modify the Better Auth model field names (User, Account, Session, Verification) — Better Auth expects them exactly as defined.
- You CAN add new fields to the User model (e.g., `bio`, `avatarUrl`). Just don't rename existing ones.

## Database (Prisma)

- All models are defined in `prisma/schema.prisma`. This is the single source of truth.
- Create a reviewed migration with `npm run db:migrate:dev -- --name <change>`, commit it, and apply reviewed migrations with `npm run db:migrate`. `npm run db:push` is an explicit, disposable-prototype-only escape hatch; it is never part of a build or deployment.
- After adding new models, run `npm run postinstall` (which runs `prisma generate`) to update the TypeScript types.
- Use `prisma` from `lib/db/prisma.ts` for all database reads and writes.
- When a model belongs to a user, add `userId String` with a relation to the User model and filter queries by `userId: session.user.id`.
- Use `@@map("table_name")` on every model to set the Postgres table name (lowercase, snake_case, plural).
- Browse data with `npm run db:studio` (opens Prisma Studio at localhost:5555).

## UI and styling

- Use shadcn/ui components for all UI elements. Install new ones with: `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component>`
- Available components: Button, Card, Input, Label, Checkbox, Badge, DropdownMenu. Install more as needed (Dialog, Table, Select, Tabs, Textarea, etc.).
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Never use inline styles or raw CSS.
- Use the theme's CSS variables (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `bg-primary`, `text-muted-foreground`). Do not use arbitrary hex colors.
- Use `cn()` from `lib/utils` when conditionally combining class names.
- Use `lucide-react` for icons.
- Keep layouts responsive — use Tailwind's responsive prefixes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`).

## Pages and routing

- File paths are routes: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` → `/dashboard`
- Pages inside `app/(authenticated)/` get an extra server-side auth check via the layout.
- The `(authenticated)` folder name is a Next.js route group — it doesn't appear in the URL.
- When creating a new page, add a navigation link so the user can reach it.

## Deployment

- This project uses two branches: `main` (working branch) and `production` (deploys to Vercel).
- Pushing to `main` does NOT deploy. Pushing to `production` triggers a Vercel build.
- To deploy: `git push origin main:production` (this pushes main's code to the production branch).
- The build command is: `prisma generate && next build`. It must not change a database. Apply reviewed production migrations as a separate deployment step with `npm run db:migrate`.
- Environment variables for production are managed with `npx vercel env add <NAME> production` or in Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables.
- Production uses a separate Neon database branch (or project) from local development.
- The /deploy slash command handles the full commit → push to main → push to production flow.

## Environment variables

- All secrets go in `.env` (never committed to git).
- Required: `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DIRECT_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, and `DIRECT_URL` are server-only secrets. `BETTER_AUTH_URL` is the public canonical origin. Never expose a secret through a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.
- Optional: `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`
- When adding a new API integration, remind the user to add the key to both `.env` (local) and Vercel Settings (production).

# Common patterns

## Create a new model + page

1. Add the model to `prisma/schema.prisma` (with user relation if needed)
2. For a disposable prototype database, run `npm run db:push`; otherwise create and review a migration, then apply it with `npm run db:migrate`.
3. Create a server action in `lib/actions/` to create/read/update/delete
4. Create a page in `app/(authenticated)/` to display the data
5. Add navigation link

## Add an AI feature

1. Install the package (`npm install replicate` or `npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai`)
2. Add the API key to `.env`
3. Create a server action that calls the API
4. Build a UI with loading states and error handling

## Make a page public

Add the path to `publicRoutes` in `proxy.ts`:
```typescript
const publicRoutes = ["/", "/sign-in", "/sign-up", "/api/auth", "/your-new-public-page"]
```
